# ghissue
Command-line Github issues client.

## Running
You need to [install stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html#how-to-install) the
haskell build tool.
```
stack build
stack install
```
This will install `ghissue-exe` into your `~/.local/bin` which should be in your path after stack is
installed.

You can run without installing using stack:
```
stack exec ghissue-exe command -- <non-stack options after the -->
```

```
ghissue: a command line github issues tool

Usage: ghissue-exe COMMAND

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text

Available commands:
  show                     Show issues
  new                      Create a new issue. If no --body is given stdin is
                           used.
  close                    Close one or more issues
  label                    Label one or more issues
  visit                    Visit an issue in your default web browser
  comment                  Attach a comment to a given issue. If no --body is
                           given stdin is used
  assign                   Assign one or more issues to a given user
```

## Configuring

This is currently done by having a file "ghissue.conf" in the `.git` directory for the
current project which contains one line of the format:
```
oauthstring githuborg repo
```
To get an oauth string, go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and create a new token. (You will need to ensure the token has `repo` or `public_repo` scopes enabled, and you will also need to ensure that issues are enabled for that repository.) Copy the auth string and save it into that file.

## Usage
`ghissue-exe --help` should give you help after you set up the configuration file. Each
command has its own help, e.g. `ghissue-exe show --help`.
